# This is the opt out file to keep track of users who have opted to never
# receive mail from you.  RemindMe will check this file before letting
# someone signup for a reminder, and will not allow them to signup if they
# have opted out.  However, it will give them an "Opt In" button so that they
# can change their minds.
