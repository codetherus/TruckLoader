Yet another overhaul...

The users want to revert to a plain "truck board" without a seperate 
driver and load page.

We will consolidate the required load info into the drivers table
and rework all of the other pages that depend on loads.

Add to the drivers table:

delivery date (deliverydate already in place)
delivery location (deliverylocation already in place)

This seems like a good time to convert to Codeigniter.
