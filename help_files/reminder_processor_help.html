<div style="margin:50px;color:black;">
<p>This page runs the server side "Tickler File" process."</p>
<p>The page contains code that runs a timer and calls the server side
process to scan the reminders/ticklers table and send email reminders to 
any due reminder.</p>
<p>When you open the page it starts the processing "timer" and runs a 
scan of the reminders table every 60 seconds. It will display the scan
time and the number of messages sent as well as who messages were sent to.</p>
<p>You may stop the timer and processing by clicking the "Stop Processing" button.</p>
<p>You may then restart the timer and processing by clicking the "Restart Processing"
button.</p>
<p>The "Status" box tells you what is going on - either "Stopped" or "Running".</p>
<p>The interval defaults to every 5 minutes but you may make it different by changing
the value if the "Interval in Minutes", stopping and restarting the processing</p>
<p>If you want to clear the display window, click the "Reset the Display" button.</p>
